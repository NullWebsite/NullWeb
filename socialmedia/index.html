      <article><h1>KingNullboy</h1><h2>My First Post</h2><p>Welcome to my mini social media project! This is the first post, and I'm excited to share this with everyone. Facebook started like this too. And by "everyone," I mean a few people. Who knows where this will go? Maybe it'll stay small, or maybe it'll grow into something more. Either way, this is just the beginning.</p></article><br><article><h1>KingNullboy</h1><h2>Alright, this still works!</h2><p></p></article>
      <br><article><h1>KingNullboy</h1><h2>I added a language filter.</h2><p>The filtered words include the normal swears, but also brainrot words. If you find a way around the filter, know this: I will not hesitate to remove or edit your post (dev perks) should the need arise.</p></article>
    <br><article><h1>KingNullboy</h1><h2>My website is really growing!</h2><p>In file size, anyway. But I'm really happy with how it's coming along. And there's even a g*mes part! I've also made the name of the entire website: NullWeb! And I decided that the color scheme is going to be black, like the rest of the website.</p></article>
