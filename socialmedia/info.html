	  <p>Welcome to NullMedia! This is a small-scale social platform where users can post updates and interact. This site was built by <a href="https://github.com/Nullboy000/" id="link">KingNullboy</a>.</p><br>
	  <p>Rules: 1. No brainrot of any sort. 2. No profanity. 3. No bypassing the language filter. 4. No threats, unless they are clearly jokes. 5. No spam. 6. Treat other users with kindness and respect. 7. Don't flood the site with self-promotion. Maybe a post promoting yourself every one or two weeks is acceptable. 8. Make this appropriate for people as young as my youngest sister, Marci, who is eight years old. 9. No clickbait. 10. Avoid excessive abbreviation and slang so that everyone can understand. 11. Instead of typing &quot;&apos;&quot;, type &#38;apos;, for the good of the site. Similarly, instead of typing &apos;&quot;&apos;, type &#38;.</p><br>
	  <p>Credits: <a href="https://github.com/Nullboy000/" id="link">KingNullboy</a> for building the site, GitHub for hosting the site, InfinityFree for providing an unbl*cked site to host to, and ChatGPT for helping with most of the code.</p><br>
	  <p>Basic code explanation for post uploading: JavaScript takes the username and password and compares it with what I have logged in the code. If the credentials are correct, it takes the body text and post title and turns it into HTML code and asks the GitHub API if it will let it add that HTML code. If all goes well, then it will deploy the updated code to my website and voila! Your post gets posted!</p><br><br>
