            <h1>How to make alternate websites</h1>
            <p>This is a tutorial on how to make websites that are literally exact copies of other websites. This is basically a pr*xy but harder. Of course, the hard work will pay off. Anyway, step one: Go to <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/" id="link" target="_blank">afraid.org</a> and sign up or sign in. Go to the <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry" id="link" target="_blank">registry</a> section. Step two: find a domain that isn't bl*cked. Go down to the thing that says "Page 1 of..." and type in the number after the word "of" and press enter. Press ctrl+f and type in public. If it says "0 of 0" then go down and click "Last page (243 of 244)." If not, copy the first thing on the row with the highlighted text (in my case "nylme.xyz") and press ctrl+t, then ctrl+v, and then enter. Then if the webpage isn't blocked, you'll go back to the domain registry and click on the first thing on the aforementioned row. It will take you to another webpage. Step three: finding the target website's IP address. Go to <a href="https://www.nslookup.io/website-to-ip-lookup/" id="link" target="_blank">NSLookup</a> and type in the website you want to make an alternative to's URL (example: www.nullmedia.infinityfreeapp.com). Hover your mouse over one of the IPv4 type thingies and click the clipboard icon. Go back to afraid.org and click on the text box next to the word "Destination:" and press ctrl+v. Step four: choose specifics. Click on the text box next to the word "Subdomain:" and type in whatever you want it to be. For example, if you want to type in "nullweb.nylme.xyz" to get to the alternative to google, you would type in google. Then do the captcha and press save. Then wait for about an hour and test out your new website!</p>
