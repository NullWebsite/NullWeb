            <p>Step 1. Find an image online or upload a custom image to GitHub. If you are adding an image from online: Copy the following: &lt;img src="linkhere"&gt;&lt;br&gt; Paste that into the body text field. Step 2. If on GitHub: Go to the image you uploaded on the spot where you can see the picture. Click "Raw" and copy the link to the website you get on. If you are adding an image from online: Find an image, right click it, and click copy image address. Step 3. Go back to the body text field and double click the part that says linkhere and paste the image address. Post it, and you're done!</p>
