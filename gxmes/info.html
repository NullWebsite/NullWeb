      <p>NullG*mes is a website with some Flash G*mes avaliable to play, there are currently <b>76</b> g*mes available to play. This website was made in mind to also provide kids in schools who have free time to be able to play old g*mes they used to enjoy but have not been able to play because of Flash shutting down.</p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>NullG*mes uses Github to host the files and as the main host and Ruffle as the service to play the g*mes. There were also straight up html files that I found online.</p>
			&nbsp; 
	    <p>This g*mes website was originally made by selenite-cc on GitHub. Nullboy000 (me) added [total number of g*mes minus 50] more g*mes and made it an actual website, not html files. (I think. I'm pretty sure selenite-cc wasn't using them to host a website, but given I'm basing that on the fact that I couldn't find it anywhere, I could be wrong.)</p>
			&nbsp;
			<p>Feel free to fork this repo. After all, that's basically what I did (I downloaded the zip of the original repo for offline capabilities, and then I uploaded the other files due to not wanting to track down the original repo again) Just if you do fork (or do what I did), be sure to give credit to me and selenite-cc.</p>
