# KingNullboy's Mini Social Media - NullMedia
This was originally a small project made so that I can chat with my friends on my own social media. However, now it's also a games site, game links site, wiki, and an iOS appifier. I realized recently that my website started pretty much the same way Facebook started, and when you think about it, maybe NullWeb will go somewhere like Facebook did. Any support is appreciated!
